# kube-monitor
Simple Desktop app for monitoring the pods in kubernetes

## How to use
Create a *.env* file with the following parameters:

```bash
KUBERNETES_DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.fancy.domain
KUBERNETES_USERNAME=charlie
KUBERNETES_PASSWORD=candy_mountain
```

To run the application you need to install the dependencies with ```npm install``` and then run ```npm start```. I will create a standalone application as soon as the code will be stable.
